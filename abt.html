            <p>Banks are financial institutions that accept deposits, lend money, and provide 
                other financial services. They act as intermediaries between depositors and borrowers.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Banks profit from the difference between the cost of attracting and servicing 
                deposits and the income they earn from interest on loans and securities. </p>
                <br>
            <p>Banks offer a variety of accounts, including savings accounts, current accounts, 
                and fixed deposits. They also provide other services like individual retirement accounts 
                (IRAs), certificates of deposit (CDs), currency exchange, and safe deposit boxes.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Banks are regulated by the laws of their home country and are typically subject to regular 
                supervision. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates banks in India. </p>
                <br>
            <p>To open a bank account, you can visit a bank branch or apply online. You will need to 
                provide identification proof, address proof, and other essential documents. </p>
